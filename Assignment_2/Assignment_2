For this assignment, you will do an analysis of the organization and stakeholders for your website. This will require you to have some insight and knowledge -- as well as the ability to communicate with -- the stakeholders in the business. If you are able, conduct interviews with stakeholders as suggested in the Stakeholders lecture. If you do not have access to the stakeholders themselves, you can glean much information about their attitudes and needs from the website.

Perform the analysis and create a table similar to the Stakeholder Analysis for Small Projects in the Stakeholder Analysis Toolkit from this module's reading. Be sure to utilize the PESTLE technique to identify all possible stakeholders.

Your table should contain:

    - Stakeholder job title/role
    - Stakeholder's stake in the project
    - The impact the stakeholder has on the project
    - What you need from the stakeholder for the project to be successful
    - The stakeholder's perceived attitudes about the project
    - The stakeholders management strategy or involvement is
    - Who/what the stakeholder is responsible for
