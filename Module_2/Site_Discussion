Hello,

For my site, I chose a local non-profit organization called the Space Foundation, here in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The site's URL is https://www.spacefoundation.org/

The space foundation website is very user-centered as it allows me, as one of the users to quickly find the information I am looking for. The information on each of the pages is concise and to the point.Â This site takes to heart the don't make me think approach that we read about in the Krug book. All of the information i am looking for are smartly divided into tabs by types of information or fields and than further into sub catagories in the pull down menus at the top. Now this site is not a one stop shop for all of the information but more of a directory to easily direct me to where I can find more information about what i am looking on a more specific site.

I am very satisfied using this site, I feel that it has the ability to answer many of the questions about the space domain in general and to route me to a variety of events where i can get involved. One of my frustrations is that there is so much information provided by this site that it can drive away anyone who is just casually viewing the site. I use the term casual viewing as anyone who doesn't have a specific question to answer by coming to the site.

I am currently working at getting access to 10 current or potential users of the site. If that fails I will move on to my second choice of websites.

By backup site, If I am unable to get the 10 required participants for the space foundation site is the https://www.worldwariiaviation.org/ which is also located here in Colorado Springs. Should I fallback upon this site I will review it for the module materials as well as list my satisfactions and frustrations with it as well.
